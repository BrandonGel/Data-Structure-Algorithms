# DSA1_Prog2
Sorting Names and SSN

This project was an assignment given by my professor to quickly sort a list with given names and SSN.

ExtraSorts is a folder of different sorting programs that were created by my friends who let me have their sort.
Test.Versions is a folder containing 30+ versions of my sorting program (some crashes or succeded but slow). other is a folder where failed/unimplemented attempts in my sorting programs.

Test.cpp is the final version of my sort with a more precise time measurement than my professor provided.
dsa1prog2.cpp is the final version of my sort that I sent to my professor for grading.
Write.cpp is a file which I used to find any creative way to speed up my sorting program.

T#.txt are the test files that my professor sent to test our sorting programs.
CT#.txt are the sorted test files that my professor sent us.
firstnames.txt and lastnames.txt contains the top 500 most popular last and first names in U.S which my professor used to create his test files.
